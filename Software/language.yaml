# The language.yaml file contains all the keywords that APRN
# clients can communicate via. This is sort of a silly way to promote
# easily readability by hams who do not have the format specified here on hand.

v1.0:
  # Ping pong!
  PING: "How copy?"
  PONG: "Good copy?"

  # Ack, error and resend
  ACKN: "Copy"
  EROR: "That didn't work!"
  RSND: "Repeat last please,"

  # Set and set error
  SETT: "Set # to #."
  OOBE: "Out of bounds."

  # General stat
  STAT: "What's your status?"

  # SSTV!
  APRN: "Send image using mode #"
  RDYT: "Ready to receive?"
  RDYR: "Ready!"
